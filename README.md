Ultra Simple React Boilerplate with JSX transpiled in browser

## Includes 

* jQuery to do AJAX-ing or anything else really.  
* Bootstrap for quick neat layout.  
* Babel to transpile the JSX in browser with no need to compile using gulp or webpack, etc.

## Requirements

Must be loaded into existing web server (eg. Apache, php -f)

## To Use

Edit app.jsx so that it actually does something cool in React.  

## Warning

Chrome may break support for doing babel transpilation in browser soon.
