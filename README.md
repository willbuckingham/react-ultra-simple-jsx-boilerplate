Ultra Simple React Boilerplate with JSX transpiled in browser

## Includes 

* jQuery to do AJAX-ing or anything else really.  
* Bootstrap for quick neat layout.  
* Babel to transpile the JSX in browser with no need to compile using gulp or webpack, etc.

## Requirements

Must be loaded into existing web server 

* Apache
* php -f
* npx serve

## To Use

Edit app.jsx so that it actually does something cool in React.  

## Warning

Chrome may break support for doing babel transpilation in browser soon.
(though it seems they haven't in the 3 years since I first did this)

## Example Project
